## Common Additions

### Adding a new option

Adding a new option to the EPANET GUI may seem simple, but there are several considerations to take into account. Please review [pull request #16](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/epanet-gui/pull/16) where Emitter Backflow option was added.

It includes notes on what needs to be changed and can act as a template for future new options.

### Adding a new selection for an existing option

Please review [pull request #12](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/epanet-gui/pull/12) where cubic meters/sec was added.

### Adding a new valve type

Please review [pull request #1](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/epanet-gui/pull/1) where positive control valves were added.
