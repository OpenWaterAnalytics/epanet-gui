This GitHub repository contains a development preview of the latest features of EPANET, developed by Open Water Analytics.

The compiled engine is combined with an updated version of the legacy EPANET Graphical User Interface (GUI), enabling community members to evaluate and test the latest features of EPANET.

The preview allows for feedback from the community, especially from those who may not be able to compile the EPANET source code themselves and prefer working within a GUI.

The latest version of the GUI and EPANET toolkit can be found under releases.

## Contributing

While contributions to this project are welcome, it is important to note that the primary focus is to allow for the testing and evaluation of the latest features of the EPANET engine.

As such, creating cosmetic changes or adding new functionality within the user interface is not the intended purpose of this project and may not be accepted as a feature request, issue, or pull request.

If there is any uncertainty about a potential contribution, we encourage opening an issue to discuss it before creating a pull request.
